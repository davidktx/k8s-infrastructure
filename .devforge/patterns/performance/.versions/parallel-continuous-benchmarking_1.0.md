# Parallel Continuous Benchmarking

## Intent
Continuously evaluate multiple algorithms or implementations in parallel, using performance metrics and competitive elimination to identify the best performing solutions.

## Problem Statement
- **Single algorithm limitation** - Using only one approach limits optimization potential
- **Manual performance comparison** - Time-consuming to test multiple implementations
- **Resource underutilization** - Single-threaded processing wastes available CPU/GPU
- **Static optimization** - No continuous improvement or adaptation
- **Performance regression** - No early detection when algorithms degrade

## Context & Applicability
- **Algorithm optimization** projects with multiple competing approaches
- **Machine learning** model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- **Performance-critical systems** requiring continuous optimization
- **Research environments** comparing different techniques
- **Any system with available parallel processing capacity**

## Solution Overview
Create a system that:
- **Runs multiple algorithms in parallel** utilizing available resources
- **Continuously measures performance** across multiple dimensions
- **Eliminates poor performers** through competitive selection
- **Adapts resource allocation** based on algorithm performance
- **Provides real-time monitoring** of optimization progress

## Structure & Components

### High-level Architecture
```
Algorithm Queue → Parallel Execution → Performance Analysis → Competitive Elimination
      ↑                    ↓                    ↓                    ↓
Resource Monitor ← GPU/CPU Monitor → Metrics Collection → Algorithm Ranking
```

### Implementation Example
```python
benchmarking_system = ParallelBenchmarking(
    algorithms=['fast_v1', 'accurate_v2', 'hybrid_v3'],
    batch_size=1000,
    max_concurrent=4,
    elimination_threshold=10000,
    target_gpu_utilization=95
)

benchmarking_system.run_continuous_optimization()
```

## Benefits & Trade-offs

**Advantages:**
- **Optimal resource utilization** - Maximizes hardware usage
- **Continuous optimization** - Always improving performance
- **Automatic selection** - No manual algorithm comparison needed
- **Performance insights** - Detailed metrics for optimization

**Disadvantages:**
- **Resource complexity** - Requires careful resource management
- **Implementation overhead** - More complex than single-algorithm approach
- **Potential instability** - Multiple processes may interfere
