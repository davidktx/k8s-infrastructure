# {GROUP_NAME} Group Checklists

## üìã Overview

This directory contains shared checklists and task coordination for the {GROUP_NAME} group. These checklists help coordinate work across all member projects and ensure consistent standards.

## üóÇÔ∏è Checklist Structure

### **Shared Coordination**
- `shared-tasks.md` - Tasks that affect multiple projects in the group
- `group-milestones.md` - Group-level milestones and deadlines
- `cross-project-integration.md` - Integration tasks between group projects
- `compliance-checklist.md` - Group compliance requirements and validation

### **Group Operations**
- `deployment-coordination.md` - Coordinated deployment procedures
- `maintenance-schedule.md` - Group maintenance and update schedules
- `incident-response.md` - Group incident response procedures
- `documentation-updates.md` - Group documentation maintenance tasks

### **Project Coordination**
- `project-sync-checklist.md` - Tasks for keeping projects synchronized
- `pattern-adoption.md` - Group pattern implementation tasks
- `standards-compliance.md` - Group standards adoption checklist

## üîÑ Checklist Synchronization

### **How Group Checklists Work**
1. **Create group-level checklists** in this directory
2. **Sync to all group projects** using sync commands
3. **Projects contribute back** their progress and updates
4. **Coordinate across projects** using shared task tracking

### **Syncing Checklists**
```bash
# Sync all group checklists to projects
python tools/project-sync.py sync-group {GROUP_NAME} --checklists-only

# Sync complete group resources including checklists
python tools/project-sync.py sync-group {GROUP_NAME}
```

## üìä Task Coordination

### **Cross-Project Tasks**
- **Shared Dependencies** - Tasks that block multiple projects
- **Integration Points** - Tasks requiring coordination between projects
- **Group Standards** - Tasks for adopting group-wide standards
- **Compliance Requirements** - Tasks for meeting group compliance needs

### **Progress Tracking**
- **Group Dashboards** - Overview of progress across all projects
- **Milestone Coordination** - Tracking group-level milestones
- **Dependency Management** - Managing cross-project dependencies
- **Issue Escalation** - Escalating issues that affect multiple projects

## üéØ Best Practices

### **Creating Group Checklists**
- **Focus on cross-project coordination** - Don't duplicate project-specific tasks
- **Clear ownership** - Specify which project(s) are responsible
- **Dependencies** - Document dependencies between projects
- **Deadlines** - Include group-level deadlines and milestones

### **Maintaining Checklists**
- **Regular updates** - Keep checklists current with project progress
- **Clear communication** - Ensure all projects understand their responsibilities
- **Progress tracking** - Monitor progress across all group projects
- **Issue resolution** - Address blockers that affect multiple projects

## üîó Integration with Project Checklists

### **Relationship to Project Checklists**
```
Group Checklists (groups/{GROUP_NAME}/checklist/)
    ‚Üì coordinate with
Project Checklists (project/checklist/)
    ‚Üì contribute to
Group Progress Tracking
```

### **Workflow**
1. **Group-level tasks** are defined in group checklists
2. **Project-specific implementation** is tracked in project checklists
3. **Progress reports** flow back to group coordination
4. **Group decisions** are communicated to all projects

*Group checklists enable coordinated task management across all {GROUP_NAME} projects, ensuring alignment and successful completion of shared objectives.*
